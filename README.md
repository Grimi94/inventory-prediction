# _Inventory Prediciton_

## Synopsis

This project explores the well know problem of **time series**. I tested out different models from sarima models to LSTM neural networks for inventory prediction.

The code includes some exploration analysis, trend analysis and finally some models in ipython notebooks. These models were then rewriten into python script and built in the web app.

The purpose of the web app is to provide some insight on the data, give recommendations by introducing product names and getting recommended products based on the ones commonly bought together.

Finally it also provides predicition for items in the inventory giving you a glimpse about what the rate of consumption will be in the following weeks.
